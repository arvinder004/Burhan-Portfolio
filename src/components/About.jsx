My curiosity for technology has led me to explore various aspects of software and hardware, from building interactive websites and applications to developing smart IoT devices that enhance everyday life.
              <br />
              With a solid foundation in languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, I enjoy creating seamless digital experiences while also integrating them with IoT solutions. My enthusiasm for cybersecurity and blockchain further fuels my desire to build secure and efficient systems. I am always eager to learn new technologies, work on innovative projects, and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

            <p className='mt-3 mb-6 text-[17px] max-w-3xl leading-[30px]'>
              Beyond technology, I have a deep love for playing football, cooking, trekking, and traveling. Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures inspires me, while football and trekking keep me active and motivated. Cooking is another passion of mine, allowing me to experiment and create something unique, much like in programming.
